In today’s world of beer, reviews and ratings of beer and breweries play a pivotal role in helping consumers choose from the wide array of options available to them that aligns with their preferences. Whether these ratings are available on an application platform, website or printed media, they significantly sway consumer’s decisions and help reform the brewing industry of brewing as well. This project explores the nuances of what affects or drives these ratings. It’s not only consumers who benefit from this work but also brewers, distributors and retailers who leverage from this work. In this regard, we have started off with obtaining data about different breweries, their available services, price and geographical location along with its associated rating given by customers. This information was scrapped using the Google Places API. Different breweries across all the states in the US were considered.
